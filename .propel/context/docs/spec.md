# Requirements Specification

## Feature Goal

Build a unified, standalone healthcare platform — the **Unified Patient Access & Clinical Intelligence Platform** — that integrates a patient-centric appointment booking system with a "Trust-First" clinical intelligence engine. The platform must transition from the current fragmented state (disconnected scheduling tools and manual clinical data extraction) to an end-to-end, role-driven system where patients can self-schedule and complete digital intake, staff can manage walk-ins and same-day queues, and clinical data extracted from uploaded documents is automatically aggregated into a verified 360-Degree Patient View with mapped ICD-10 and CPT codes.

## Business Justification

- Providers experience up to 15% no-show rates due to complex booking processes and a lack of smart reminders; the platform reduces this through rule-based no-show risk scoring and automated multi-channel reminders.
- Clinical staff spend 20+ minutes manually extracting patient data from multi-format PDF reports; the platform reduces this to a 2-minute AI-assisted verification workflow, eliminating a primary bottleneck in clinical preparation.
- Existing solutions are fragmented — booking tools lack clinical data context, and current AI tools face a "Black Box" trust deficit requiring manual verification; this platform bridges both gaps with a transparent, source-traceable aggregation engine.
- The platform serves patients (self-service booking, digital intake), administrative staff (walk-in management, arrival marking, queue oversight), and admins (user lifecycle management), delivering measurable improvements across all three roles.
- A Dynamic Preferred Slot Swap feature reduces patient scheduling friction and maximizes slot utilization, directly impacting revenue recovery from unfilled cancellations.

## Feature Scope

The platform is scoped to Phase 1 and covers the following user-visible behaviors and technical capabilities:

**Patient-facing**: Self-registration, appointment booking with waitlist/preferred slot swap, AI-assisted or manual intake, insurance pre-check, clinical document upload, calendar sync, PDF confirmation via email, appointment reminders, and a patient dashboard.

**Staff-facing**: Walk-in booking (with optional account creation), same-day queue management, arrival marking, clinical data review and conflict resolution, medical code verification.

**Admin-facing**: User account lifecycle management (Staff and Admin roles), role assignment, audit log access.

**Clinical Intelligence**: Ingestion of uploaded PDFs, extraction of structured clinical data (vitals, medications, diagnoses, allergies), de-duplication, conflict detection, ICD-10/CPT code suggestion, and a 360-Degree Patient View.

**Out of Scope**: Provider logins or provider-facing actions, payment gateway integration, family member profiles, patient self-check-in (mobile, web portal, or QR code), direct bi-directional EHR integration, full claims submission, and paid cloud infrastructure (AWS, Azure).

### Success Criteria

- [ ] No-show rate demonstrably reduced from the 15% baseline after platform adoption, measurable via appointment completion rates.
- [ ] Clinical data retrieval time reduced from 20 minutes to 2 minutes, measured by time-to-complete the 360-degree view verification workflow.
- [ ] AI-Human Agreement Rate exceeds 98% for suggested ICD-10/CPT codes and extracted clinical data elements.
- [ ] Zero critical HIPAA compliance violations; all data handling, transmission, and storage passes a HIPAA compliance audit.
- [ ] Platform achieves 99.9% uptime measured over a rolling 30-day window.
- [ ] "Critical Conflicts Identified" metric is quantifiable and tracked per patient record.
- [ ] All patient appointments generate a PDF confirmation email within 60 seconds of booking.
- [ ] Session auto-timeout activates at exactly 15 minutes of inactivity across all roles.

- **FR-037**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST update the corresponding calendar event when an appointment is rescheduled and remove the calendar event when an appointment is cancelled, propagating changes to the patient's connected calendar service.

### Domain J: Insurance Pre-Check

- **FR-038**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST perform a soft insurance pre-check during the booking flow by matching the patient-provided insurance name and member ID against a predefined internal set of dummy insurer records maintained by the system.
- **FR-039**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST display a clear insurance validation status to the patient after pre-check: "Verified" (match found), "Not Recognized" (no match), or "Incomplete" (missing fields), with guidance text for each outcome.
- **FR-040**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST allow the appointment booking workflow to proceed to confirmation regardless of the insurance pre-check outcome, treating the pre-check as informational rather than a blocking gate.

### Domain K: Clinical Document Upload

### Domain L: 360-Degree Patient View (Clinical Data Aggregation)

- **FR-045**: [AI-CANDIDATE] System MUST process each uploaded patient PDF document using an AI extraction pipeline to identify and extract structured clinical data elements including vitals (blood pressure, heart rate, weight, height), current and historical medications with dosages, diagnoses with dates, allergies, immunization history, and surgical history.
- **FR-046**: [AI-CANDIDATE] System MUST aggregate extracted clinical data elements from all uploaded documents for a patient into a single, de-duplicated patient profile view, eliminating duplicate entries for the same data element while preserving all unique values.
- **FR-047**: [HYBRID] System MUST present the aggregated 360-degree patient view to authenticated Staff-role users in a structured review interface, requiring explicit staff verification before the view is marked as "Verified" and made available for clinical use.
- **FR-048**: [AI-CANDIDATE] System MUST reduce the clinical data retrieval workflow to a maximum of 2 minutes for a staff member to review and verify the aggregated 360-degree view for a patient with up to 10 uploaded documents, measured from page load to verification action.
- **FR-049**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST maintain a source traceability record for every extracted data element in the 360-degree view, linking each element to its originating document name, page number (where applicable), and upload timestamp.

### Domain M: Medical Code Extraction

### Domain N: Data Conflict Detection & Resolution

- **FR-054**: [AI-CANDIDATE] System MUST detect conflicting data elements across two or more uploaded documents for the same patient — specifically including conflicting medication names, dosages, allergy entries, and diagnosis dates — and classify each conflict by severity (Critical / Warning).
- **FR-055**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST explicitly highlight all detected conflicts within the 360-degree patient view using a visually distinct conflict indicator, displaying the conflicting values side by side with the source document identified for each value.
- **FR-056**: [HYBRID] System MUST require an authenticated Staff-role user to explicitly resolve or acknowledge each identified data conflict — by selecting the authoritative value or marking the conflict as reviewed — before the patient's 360-degree profile can be marked as "Complete."

### Domain O: Audit Logging

- **FR-057**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST maintain an immutable, append-only audit log capturing every patient data access event, including the accessing user's ID and role, the patient record accessed, the action performed (view/create/update/delete), and a UTC timestamp.
- **FR-058**: [DETERMINISTIC] System MUST log all clinical data modification events — including document uploads, intake edits, code confirmations, conflict resolutions, and 360-degree view verifications — with full before-and-after state capture where applicable.

#### UC-003: Patient Completes Manual Intake Form

- **Actor(s)**: Patient
- **Goal**: Complete the intake form using a traditional structured form without AI assistance.
- **Preconditions**: Patient has a confirmed appointment booking; intake is incomplete.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Patient opens the intake interface and selects "Manual Form" mode.
  2. System renders the structured intake form with all required and optional fields.
  3. Patient fills in demographic and clinical fields (medical history, medications, allergies, conditions).
  4. Patient saves a draft at any time; system autosaves on field blur.
  5. Patient submits the completed form; system validates required fields and saves the intake record.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 1a. Patient was in AI intake and switches to manual → Form is pre-populated with previously parsed values.
  - 5a. Required fields are missing → System highlights missing fields; submission is blocked until resolved.
- **Postconditions**: Intake record is saved, linked to the appointment, and marked complete on the patient dashboard.

#### UC-004: Preferred Slot Swap Triggered Automatically

- **Actor(s)**: Notification Service (System Actor), Patient (notified)
- **Goal**: Automatically move a patient to their preferred appointment slot when it becomes available.
- **Preconditions**: A patient has a confirmed booking and an active preferred slot waitlist entry; the preferred slot is currently unavailable.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Another patient cancels or reschedules an appointment, releasing the slot.
  2. System detects that the released slot matches a waitlisted preferred slot entry.
  3. System executes the slot swap within 60 seconds: cancels the patient's current booking and assigns them to the preferred slot.
  4. System releases the patient's original slot to the general availability pool.
  5. Notification Service sends an email and SMS to the patient with the new appointment details.
  6. System updates the patient's dashboard to reflect the new appointment.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 2a. Multiple patients have the same preferred slot waitlisted → System applies first-in-first-out (FIFO) ordering; remaining patients retain their waitlist entries.
  - 5a. SMS delivery fails → System logs the failure and retries once; email delivery is treated as confirmation fallback.
- **Postconditions**: Patient is confirmed in the preferred slot; original slot is available; patient is notified; audit log records the swap event.

#### UC-005: Staff Creates a Walk-In Booking

- **Actor(s)**: Staff
- **Goal**: Register an unscheduled patient visit and optionally create a patient account.
- **Preconditions**: Staff is authenticated; at least one appointment slot is available for the current day (or walk-in is added to queue without a specific slot).
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Staff navigates to the walk-in booking interface.
  2. Staff searches for an existing patient by name or date of birth.
  3. If found, staff selects the patient and proceeds to slot selection.
  4. If not found, staff optionally creates a basic patient profile (name, contact, email).
  5. Staff assigns the walk-in to an available slot or adds them to the same-day queue.
  6. System confirms the walk-in booking and adds the patient to the same-day queue view.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 4a. Staff skips account creation → Walk-in is tracked as anonymous; system generates a temporary visit ID.
  - 5a. No slots available → Staff adds the patient to a walk-in overflow queue with a wait-time estimate.
- **Postconditions**: Walk-in booking is recorded, patient appears in the same-day queue view with status "Pending Arrival."

#### UC-006: Staff Marks Patient as Arrived

- **Actor(s)**: Staff
- **Goal**: Record that a patient has physically arrived for their appointment, updating the queue view.
- **Preconditions**: Staff is authenticated; appointment exists in today's same-day queue with status "Pending Arrival."
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Staff opens the same-day queue view.
  2. Staff locates the patient's appointment entry.
  3. Staff clicks "Mark as Arrived."
  4. System updates the appointment status to "Arrived" with a timestamp.
  5. Queue view reflects the updated status in real time.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 3a. Patient appointment is not in today's queue → Staff searches by patient name or reference number; system retrieves the record.
- **Postconditions**: Appointment status is "Arrived" with an arrival timestamp recorded; audit log captures the staff ID and action timestamp.

#### UC-007: Patient Uploads Clinical Documents

- **Actor(s)**: Patient
- **Goal**: Upload one or more historical clinical PDF documents for AI-based extraction and profile enrichment.
- **Preconditions**: Patient is authenticated and has an active patient dashboard.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Patient navigates to the document upload section of the dashboard.
  2. Patient selects one or more PDF files (up to 20 files, 25 MB each).
  3. System validates file type (PDF only) and file size for each document.
  4. System encrypts and stores each document at rest using AES-256.
  5. System queues each document for processing by the Clinical Intelligence Engine.
  6. Dashboard updates the document upload history with upload status per file.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 3a. File exceeds 25 MB → System rejects that file and notifies the patient with an error message; other valid files proceed.
  - 3b. Non-PDF file selected → System rejects the file and displays a supported format message.
  - 5a. Intelligence Engine processing is delayed → Dashboard shows "Processing" status; patient is notified by email when extraction is complete.
- **Postconditions**: Documents are securely stored, processing is queued, upload history is updated, audit log records the upload event.

#### UC-008: System Generates 360-Degree Patient View

- **Actor(s)**: Clinical Intelligence Engine (System Actor), Staff
- **Goal**: Process all uploaded patient documents to produce a unified, de-duplicated, verified patient clinical profile.
- **Preconditions**: At least one clinical document has been uploaded and queued for processing; Staff member opens the patient's 360-degree view.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Clinical Intelligence Engine extracts structured data from each uploaded PDF (vitals, medications, diagnoses, allergies, surgical/immunization history).
  2. System aggregates extracted data from all documents, de-duplicating identical entries.
  3. System detects conflicting values across documents and flags them with severity classification.
  4. System presents the aggregated 360-degree view to the Staff member in a structured review interface.
  5. Staff reviews extracted data, resolves flagged conflicts by selecting authoritative values, and verifies the profile.
  6. System marks the 360-degree profile as "Verified" and makes it available for clinical use.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 1a. Document is unreadable or corrupted → System marks that document as "Extraction Failed" and excludes it, notifying staff.
  - 3a. No conflicts detected → System displays the unified view without conflict indicators; staff proceeds directly to verification.
- **Postconditions**: 360-degree patient profile is "Verified," source traceability records exist for all data elements, conflicts are resolved, audit log captures verification event.

#### UC-009: Staff Reviews and Confirms Extracted Medical Codes

- **Actor(s)**: Staff, Clinical Intelligence Engine
- **Goal**: Review AI-suggested ICD-10 and CPT codes and confirm or reject each code for the patient's encounter record.
- **Preconditions**: 360-degree patient view is "Verified"; Clinical Intelligence Engine has generated suggested codes.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Staff opens the medical coding review interface for a patient encounter.
  2. System displays a list of AI-suggested ICD-10 codes with supporting clinical evidence for each.
  3. System displays a list of AI-suggested CPT codes with supporting procedure evidence for each.
  4. Staff reviews each suggested code and selects "Confirm" or "Reject" for each.
  5. Staff may manually add a code not suggested by the AI.
  6. Staff submits the confirmed code set; system saves codes linked to the patient record and encounter.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 4a. Staff rejects a code → System removes it from the confirmed set and logs the rejection with staff ID.
  - 5a. Staff adds a manual code → System validates the code format against the ICD-10/CPT standard code library before saving.
- **Postconditions**: Confirmed ICD-10 and CPT codes are saved, linked to the encounter, with staff confirmation timestamp recorded.

#### UC-010: Admin Manages User Accounts

- **Actor(s)**: Admin
- **Goal**: Create, view, edit, deactivate, and assign roles to Staff and Admin user accounts.
- **Preconditions**: Admin is authenticated.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Admin navigates to the User Management interface.
  2. System displays a list of all managed user accounts with name, role, status, and last login.
  3. Admin selects an action: Create, Edit, Deactivate, or Change Role.
  4. For deactivation or role elevation to Admin, system prompts Admin to re-authenticate (confirm password).
  5. Admin confirms the re-authentication and the action is executed.
  6. System applies the change; affected user's next session reflects the new state.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 4a. Re-authentication fails → System rejects the action and logs the failed attempt.
  - 3a. Admin creates a new Staff account → System sends a credential setup email to the new user.
- **Postconditions**: User account changes are persisted; audit log records the Admin action with before/after state.

#### UC-011: System Sends Appointment Reminders

- **Actor(s)**: Notification Service (System Actor), Staff (manual trigger)
- **Goal**: Deliver automated and manual appointment reminders to patients via email and SMS.
- **Preconditions**: Appointment is in "Confirmed" status; patient has a registered email and phone number.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. System scheduler evaluates upcoming appointments at each configured reminder interval (48h, 24h, 2h).
  2. For each eligible appointment, Notification Service sends an email and SMS reminder with appointment details.
  3. System logs each delivery event (channel, status, timestamp) to the audit trail.
  4. (Manual flow) Staff accesses appointment detail and clicks "Send Reminder Now."
  5. Notification Service dispatches an ad-hoc email and SMS immediately.
  6. System logs the manual trigger event with the staff member's ID.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 2a. SMS delivery fails → System logs the failure and retries once after 5 minutes; email is treated as delivery confirmation.
  - 2b. Appointment is cancelled before a scheduled reminder fires → System suppresses the reminder and logs the suppression event.
- **Postconditions**: Reminder delivery events are logged; patient has received notification(s) per configured schedule.

#### UC-012: Patient Syncs Appointment to External Calendar

- **Actor(s)**: Patient, Calendar Service (System Actor)
- **Goal**: Export a confirmed appointment to the patient's Google Calendar or Outlook calendar.
- **Preconditions**: Patient has a confirmed appointment; patient initiates calendar sync from the dashboard or confirmation page.
- **Success Scenario**:
  1. Patient clicks "Add to Calendar" on the appointment confirmation page or dashboard.
  2. System presents calendar options: "Google Calendar" and "Outlook."
  3. Patient selects preferred calendar service.
  4. System generates a calendar event with appointment details and initiates the appropriate API call or provides an ICS download.
  5. Calendar Service creates the event in the patient's selected calendar.
  6. System confirms successful sync and displays the event link to the patient.
- **Extensions/Alternatives**:
  - 4a. Patient selects ICS download → System generates and serves the ICS file for manual import.
  - 5a. Calendar API authorization is denied by patient → System displays a permission guidance message; no event is created.
  - Reschedule/Cancel: System updates or deletes the calendar event via the same API when the appointment changes.
- **Postconditions**: Calendar event exists in the patient's chosen calendar service with correct appointment details.

## Risks & Mitigations

1. **AI Accuracy Below 98% Threshold (Critical)**: The ICD-10/CPT code suggestion and clinical data extraction accuracy may fall below the 98% AI-Human Agreement Rate target due to variability in PDF document quality, handwriting, or non-standard clinical terminology. _Mitigation_: Implement a mandatory human-in-the-loop verification step (FR-047, FR-052) for all AI-generated outputs; log and track AI-Human disagreement rates as a KPI to trigger model retraining cycles.

2. **HIPAA Compliance Violation Risk (Critical)**: Improper handling of PHI (Protected Health Information) — including insufficient encryption, inadequate access controls, or missing audit logs — could result in regulatory penalties. _Mitigation_: Enforce AES-256 at rest and TLS 1.2+ in transit (FR-043), maintain immutable audit logs (FR-057, FR-058), enforce RBAC on all PHI access (FR-001), and conduct a HIPAA security assessment prior to production launch.

3. **Slot Swap Race Condition (High)**: Concurrent preferred slot monitoring by multiple waitlisted patients for the same preferred slot may result in a race condition where the same slot is assigned to more than one patient. _Mitigation_: Implement distributed locking or a database-level optimistic concurrency mechanism on slot assignment (FR-013, FR-022); apply FIFO ordering for waitlist resolution (UC-004 Extension 2a).

4. **Document Format Variability Degrading Extraction (Medium)**: Uploaded PDF documents may be scanned images, password-protected, or in non-standard layouts, causing AI extraction pipeline failures. _Mitigation_: Implement pre-processing validation to detect corrupted or image-only PDFs and mark them as "Extraction Failed" with a staff notification (UC-008 Extension 1a); define supported document specifications in the patient-facing upload guidance.

5. **Free-Tier Platform Reliability Constraints (Medium)**: Hosting on free-tier platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Codespaces) introduces cold-start latency, rate limits, and availability constraints that may impact the 99.9% uptime NFR. _Mitigation_: Architect the backend as stateless microservices (FR design consideration) to maximize cold-start recovery speed; use Upstash Redis for low-latency session and cache operations; implement graceful degradation for non-critical features.

## Constraints & Assumptions

1. **No Paid Cloud Infrastructure**: The platform must be hosted exclusively on free, open-source-friendly platforms (Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Codespaces). AWS, Azure, GCP, and equivalent paid cloud services are strictly out of scope for Phase 1. All auxiliary tools and services must be free and open-source.

2. **Technology Stack is Fixed**: The frontend is Angular 17 with Standalone Components and RxJS; the backend is .NET 8 ASP.NET Core Web API with a microservices architecture, Entity Framework Core, and PostgreSQL. Deviations from this stack require explicit change approval and are out of scope.

3. **Insurance Validation is Soft and Dummy-Record-Based**: The insurance pre-check validates against a predefined, internally maintained set of dummy records only (FR-038). No real-time integration with actual insurance payer systems is in scope for Phase 1; results are informational and non-blocking.

4. **Clinical AI is Not a Regulated Medical Device**: The AI clinical data extraction and medical code suggestion features are decision-support tools only. All AI-generated outputs are subject to mandatory human staff verification (FR-047, FR-052, FR-056) and must never be applied to patient records without explicit staff confirmation. The platform does not certify or warrant clinical accuracy of AI outputs.

5. **No Provider-Facing Functionality**: Provider logins, provider scheduling configuration, provider-patient messaging, and any provider-driven clinical actions are explicitly out of scope. All clinical data verification and medical code confirmation actions are performed by Staff-role users, not clinical providers.
